# SYN-sender
This Python program is designed to send SYN requests, a crucial part of the TCP three-way handshake, for the purpose of understanding networking and how computers communicate over the internet. Creating and sending SYN requests is a fundamental skill in the field of networking and cybersecurity. By developing this program, I hope to gain hands-on experience in crafting and sending network packets. Building the basics of my knowledge of network protocols, all while improving my programming knowledge.

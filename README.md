# packets
This Python program is designed to send SYN requests, and other packets, for the purpose of understanding networking and how computers communicate over the internet. Creating and sending packets is a fundamental skill in the field of networking and cybersecurity. By developing this program, I hope to gain hands-on experience in crafting and sending network packets.
